# POX: upstream BakaSU main suspends the SUSFS build here with an unconditional
# $(error), pending simonpunk syncing SUSFS with main's selinux_hide rework.
# The BakaSU<->SUSFS kernel interface is unchanged for non-GKI 4.14 (SUSFS falls
# back to the auto selinux_hide hook), so the build is allowed to proceed.
